The prototype scope was carefully considered, as the purpose of the prototype was not
to have a full working system but rather to see how our understanding of the requirements
and workflow match up to our clients. As such only critical features relating to the key
flow of the program were included in the scope. These were decided to be a multi-user view,
viewing advertisments as each user (with appropriate restrictions as a student 
or company), approving or rejecting submitted advertisments by the course coordinator and 
submitting advertisements as the company. These features were all included and to some degree
implemented. We also included various features that do not currently do anything but were
classified as important to the workflow and so included in the appropriate places. This includes 
the actual process of logging into the system as each user, amending adverts, students declaring
successfull application and viewing student declarations of success.
