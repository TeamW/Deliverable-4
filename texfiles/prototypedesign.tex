The design of the prototype was driven by the simplicity of the scope and the bash language. Once we agreed on
what we wished to learn from the prototype and used this to decide the scope, we were able to draw up a simple
set of text-based menus that demonstrated the functionality and workflow such that the clients could have a 
meaningful look at how we understood the requirements.
