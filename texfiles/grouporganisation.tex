\subsection{Authority}

The group has decided to delegate authority by role. Roles are volunteered for
on a temporary basis, allowing both flexibility and persisitence, as the
member or group decides. Roles can be rotated or adjusted to allow for
circumstances such as deadlines or illness. This approach was chosen to play
to the individual members' strengths and to facilite group cohesion, as none
of us can claim to be `senior' to the others.

Decisions will primarily be made on a democratic voting method where any
major changes are brought forward to the whole group, discussed, then voted
on. For minor decisions, such as role specific decisions, these can be made
by the individual it soley affects.

With the democratic voting method with prior discussion disputes should be
rare. Majority vote rules and should be accepted by all members of the team.

\subsection{Communication}

The group will be using three main methods of communication: a communal
Facebook group, bi-weekly face-to-face meetings in the third year lab,
and GitHub.

Facebook will provide us the tools to post messages for all to see, and the
ability to have real time chat with members currently online.

The face to face meetings will allows us to take part in pair programming,
group discussion, and general progress report.
