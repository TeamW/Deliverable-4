The main features of the prototype were identified by considering both what we wished to show to
and learn from the client. We decided that we needed to be sure that the basic workflow of the system 
as we understood it matched up to the clients expectations, and so it was decided that the prototype should
allow the user to see full structure of the systems workflow, even if some of the functionality wasn't actually 
there. This resulted in the list of functional and non-functional features that were developed in the prototype.
The core functional features were decided to be submitting, approving and viewing adverts, as applicable for 
each type of user. Being core features these were implemented to a degree such that the client could actually
interact with these features freely and give us whatever feedback came up as they actually used the system. 
The fact that we designed the prototype to include the user-types was important, as this is key to the system 
workflow and we needed to be sure that we understood the functions and limitations of each user as envisaged
by the client and required by the system.
