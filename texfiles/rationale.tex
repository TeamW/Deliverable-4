The main features of the prototype were identified by considering both what we wished to show to
and learn from the client. We decided that we needed to be sure that the basic workflow of the system 
as we understood it matched up to the clients expectations, and so it was decided that the prototype should
allow the user to see full structure of the systems workflow, even if some of the functionality wasn't actually 
there. This resulted in the list of functional and non-functional features that were developed in the prototype.
The core features were decided to be submitting, approving and viewing adverts, as applicable for each type
of user.
